        Housing in India varies from palaces of erstwhile maharajas to modern apartment buildings in big cities to tiny huts in far-flung villages. 
        There has been tremendous growth in India's housing sector as incomes have risen. The Human Rights Measurement Initiative finds that India is doing 60.9% of 
        what should be possible at its level of income for the right to housing.
        Renting, also known as hiring or letting, is an agreement where a payment is made for the temporary use of a good, service, 
        or property owned by another. A gross lease is when the tenant pays a flat rental amount and the landlord pays 
        for all property charges regularly incurred by the ownership. Renting can be an example of the sharing economy. </p>
